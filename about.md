Hello there! My name is Divyanshu Shende. I am student in the [CSE department](www.cse.iitk.ac.in) at [IIT Kanpur](iitk.ac.in). More details on the same are on the [Academics](../academics/) page.

I am interested not only in Computer Science, but also science in general. I love Mathematics, especially [Discrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics). [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) and [Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) are some of my favourite topics. Physics is another subject that I like. Some of my favourite topics in Physics include [Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics) and Rotational Mechanics (yes, chapter 10 from [HCV](http://www.amazon.in/Concepts-Physics-1-H-C-Verma/dp/8177091875)). I do enjoy reading up on latest scientific developments. I am (perhaps superficially) also interested in [Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy).

Apart from the above topics, I am also interested in [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy). In my free time, I often wonder about topics like [Free Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) and [Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), [Dream Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument) and even [Philosophy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science). Any discussion on these is always welcome. However, my thinking is not limited to the above mentioned topics. In fact, I'm always willing to listen to any new information with an open mind and I am always up for a brainstorming session.

In extra curricular activities, I try to give back to the community in certain ways. I love learning and sharing any knowledge that I have. This led me to apply for the post of Academic Mentor, and later Core Team Academics, in the Institute [Counselling Service](http://www.iitk.ac.in/counsel/) which has taught me a lot of things and where I met some of the nicest people I know. I am also a part of [NERD](http://www.iitk.ac.in/nerd/web/) where I met other science enthusiasts.

And that's about it. I think I am best described as an introvert. A favourite pastime of mine is sitting down with a cup of tea (oh the joy! <i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and brainstorming about something : be it an idea, a life problem or a puzzle. Apart from this, I do read occasionally.
