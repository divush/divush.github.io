Hello there! My name is Divyanshu Shende. I am student in the [CSE department](www.cse.iitk.ac.in) at [IIT Kanpur](iitk.ac.in). More details on the same are on the [Academics](../academics/) page (seriously, why even look there?).

I am interested not only in Computer Science, but also science in general. I love Mathematics, especially [Discrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics). [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) and [Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) are some of my favourite topics. Physics is another of my favourite subjects. Some of my favourite topics in Physics include [Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics) and Rotational Mechanics (yes, chapter 10 from [HCV](http://www.amazon.in/Concepts-Physics-1-H-C-Verma/dp/8177091875)). I do enjoy reading up on latest scientific developments. I am (perhaps superficially) interested in [Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) (no, it's not palm reading. That's Astrology).

Apart from the above topics, I am also interested in [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy). In my free time, I often wonder about topics like [Free Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) and [Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), [Dream Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument) and even [Philosophy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science). Any discussion on these is always welcome. However, my thinking is not limited to the above mentioned topics. In fact, I'm always willing to listen to any new information with an open mind and I am always up for a brainstorming session.

In extra curricular activities, I try to give back to the community in certain ways. I love learning and sharing any knowledge that I have. This led me to apply for the post of Academic Mentor, and later Core Team Academics, in the Institute [Counselling Service](http://www.iitk.ac.in/counsel/) which has taught me a lot of things and where I met some of the nicest people I know. I also was a part of [NERD](http://www.iitk.ac.in/nerd/web/) (click the link to find out the full form) where I met other science enthusiasts.

And that's about it. Despite writing so much, I claim that I am introvert with a not-so-good sense of humor (effect and cause, perhaps?). So if you spot me alone at a canteen sipping tea (my first love! <i class="fa fa-coffee" aria-hidden="true"></i>), then chances are, that I'm completely lost, thinking about something that could possibly be inconsequential, and which I'll probably leave for another thought, before I take the next sip.
