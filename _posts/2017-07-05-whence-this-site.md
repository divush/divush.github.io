***Why did I bother to create this site?***

If you have met me, you would probably be surpirised by this site (conditions apply: if you care enough). The reason is that I was once an avid Computer Science Theorist who denounced the importance of anything that the other branches (Systems, ML) had to do (in my defense: dark times, bad influences). But I did spend about 3-4 days trying to create this website. So why did I do it?

Here are a few reasons off the top of my head (not in order of importance).
<ul>
    <li> <strong> Placement Season </strong>: Yes, placement season is coming up and at the point of writing this, I'm preparing for it. This site, I believe, is a decent showcasing of my Web Dev skills. And the Jekyll template saves me the effort of coming up with sensible designs and implementing them from scratch (ironically, perhaps what a web developer is supposed to do).</li>
    <br />
    <li> <strong> Need </strong>: I am currently pusuing a Dual Degree and will (most probably) be working in the next year or so. It makes sense, at this point, to make a site so that people interested in my past and future work, theoretical or otherwise, can look at it. Not to mention, the <a href="/old.html" target="\_blank">old site</a> was kind of embarrasing.  </li>
    <br />
    <li> <strong> Possibility </strong>: More than being a showcase of my skills, this site has the potential to become a portal for me to jot down my thoughts. This is partly due to the simplicity with which Jekyll allows me to create a simple post. The remainder comes from the fact that I know, although little, about few things. This could allow me to disseminate that knowledge too. </li>
    <br />
    <li> <strong> Fun factor </strong>: This is perhaps the most important and productive reason. To be honest, I wanted to create a site simpler than this (but still better than the old site). But once I started adding some functionality to it, I noticed that I wanted to do even more. Building or creating something is fun and this kept me going. After this experience, I think I understand why people like Systems after all! </li>
</ul>

So those are all that I could think of at the moment. See if any of these apply to you. It might help you decide if you should build a site too. I'll probably be writing about how I created this site and that should help you as well. So keep looking and feel free to comment below!
